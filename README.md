# First Challenge 2021

* Write a function that returns true if the brackets in a given string are balanced.
* Balanced means that every parenthesis/bracket or brace that is opened must be closed, and it must be closed in the right order (always close the last symbol you opened).
* The function must handle parens (), square brackets [], and curly braces {}.

Test expressions:
* '(a[0]+b[2c[6]]) {24+53})'
* 'f(e(d))[()]{}([])'
* '((b)'
* '(c]'
* '{(a[])'
* '([)]'
* ')('
* ''
